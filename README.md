# MDF
Magnetic Particle Imaging Data Format

This repository contains the specification of the Magnetic Particle Imaging Data Format (MDF) and example code that shows how to perform a simple reconstruction.

In order to apply the example code, one has to download examplary MPI data from http://www.tuhh.de/ibi/research/mpi-data-format.html into the root directory of this repository.

## Sanity Check
As of version 1.0.1 a sanity check to test and debug MDF files is provided. It is written in the `Julia` programming language, which is availible on http://julialang.org/. For more details we refer to the REDME within the `julia` folder.

## Example Code
Alongside the MDF specifications code examples written in `Julia`, `Matlab` and `Python` are provided. These can be used as example for basic interaction with MDF files. For more details please take a look into the respective REDME files within the language subfolders.
