# Magnetic Particle Imaging Data Format (MDF)
This repository contains the specification of the MDF and example code that shows how to handle MDF files and how to perform a simple reconstruction. In order to getting started run one of the Julia/Python/Matlab example scripts which will download experimental test datasets and perform a simple reconstruction.

## related Publication
As of version 1.0.1 the most recent release of these specifications can also be also found on the arXiv http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06072. If you use MDF please cite us using the arXiv reference, which is also available for download as `MDF.bib`.

## Example Code
Alongside the MDF specifications several small code examples written in **Julia**, **Matlab** and **Python** are provided. Irrespective of the language all examples implement the same algorithm. The example code can be used as a reference for basic interaction with MDF files. For more details please take a look into the respective README files within the language subfolders.
